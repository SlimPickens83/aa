This is a proof of concept website for a small accounting firm. It still in development but the front and backend are both functional. The frontend app utilizes React for browser-side routing; the backend is an Express app in communication with a MongoDB database.

The plan is that the website will have a somewhat standard guest presentation with information about the business including services offered and how to contact. Registered clients will be able to login and view current and/or ongoing jobs being handled by the business as well as invoices and any unpaid balances. Long term the plan is that the business will provide a service that streamlines commissions calculations for insurance companies and their agents.
